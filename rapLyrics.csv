Yet I get treated just the opposite Despite I'm either out of this world or sitting on top of it I'm just being who I am but can they say the same? Or do they stay ashamed Cause they eyes denies a greater flame?

My album was raw because no-one would ever Think like I think and do what I do I stole the show, and then I leave without a clue What do you think makes up a KRS? Concisive teaching, or very clear speaking? Ridiculous bass, aggravating treble Rebel, renegade, must stay paid Not by financial aid, but a raid of hits Causing me to take long trips I'm the original teacher of this type of style Rockin' off-beat with a smile Or smirk or chuckle, yes some are not up to BDP Posse so I love to Step in the jam and slam I'm not Superman, because anybody can Or should be able to rock off turntables Grab the mic, plug it in and begin But here's where the problem starts, no heart Because of that a lot of groups fell apart Rap is still an art, and no-one's from the Old School 'cause Rap is still a brand-new tool I say no-one's from the Old School 'cause Rap on a whole Isn't even twenty years old Fifty years down the line, you can start this 'cause we'll be the Old School artists And even in that time, I'll say a rhyme A brand-new style, ruthless and wild Runnin' around spendin' money, havin' fun 'cause even then, I'm still number one.

Old School artists don't always burn You're just another rapper who's had his turn Now it's my turn, and I am concerned About idiots posing as kings What are we here to rule? I thought we were supposed to sing And if we oughta sing, then let us begin to teach Many of you are educated, open your mouth and speak KRS-One is something like a total renegade Except I don't steal, I rhyme to get paid Airplanes flyin', overseas people dyin' Politicians lyin', I'm tryin' Not to escape, but hit the problem head-on By bringin' out the truth in a song So BDP, short for Boogie Down Productions Made a little noise 'cause the crew was sayin' somethin' People have the nerve to take me for a gangster An ignorant one, something closer to a prankster Doin' petty crimes, goin' straight to penitentiary But in a scale of crime that's really elementary This beat is now compelling me to explain in silence Why my last jam was so violent It's simple  BDP will teach reality No beatin' around the bush, straight up, just like The P Is Free So now you know, a poet's job is never done But I'm never overworked, 'cause I'm still number one."

13309,behind-you,2016,foxal,Hip-Hop,"Love your life, yeah that's how you live. It's yours to take but learn when to give. Give others hope and don't you give in, Cause the night must end 'fore the morning begins. Just do you, stay real and true, To all that's inside, the nails and screws, That hold you together, and through stormy weather, You and I, let's do this together now. Life is your own, and you reap what you sew. The people will come and your friends they may go. Stop doubting yourself cause there's one thing I know, It's that flowers need rain before they can grow. And I know that feeling, like ""Why do I matter?"" My words could be sweeter than cookie dough batter, And she still wouldn't love me... I hate that I know that just I can't have her. It may be a battle, you may have to fight, And I know you lay there and cry every night. I know the pain that you're feeling inside, Is this rain that I feel or can God really cry? If life is really a test, then someone gave me the wrong answer sheet. Oh well, cause I might just cheat. Cause we've all been through it, I write all this music, To tell you that pain is a tool, so I use it, To fight all my demons, the monsters I deal with, I love you, was that brave or stupid? But It's all okay, I'll be just fine. The morning will come and the sun will rise, Realize that pain is just part of life, So take it slowly, one day at a time. You're not broken, you've got a past. I can see your potential right through your mask. This world is yours, don't need to ask, It's ready so take it and never look back. I see all your scars and all that you've been through, But keep your head up and remember that I'm right behind you. (CHORUS) Each breath is a gift that's worth more than Gold Your life is your story that's yet to be told. Be who you are, be ruthless and bold You wouldn't know warm if you weren't ever cold.. You're stronger in heart than you'll ever know. Lift up your glass, let's make a toast. To the ones who took life and made it their own, The people who fought and who and made themselves known. (CHORUS) But, Listen, You're gonna take a few hits. And it's gonna be hard, But I promise it's gonna be worth it. I know that life, ain't always easy, It's hard enough just to find some meaning, You put on a mask just to hide what you're feeling Cause the darkness within, is just too revealing. Whatever you feel, you're never alone. There's someone out there who knows that you know. Someone whose pain, comes so close to home, We're all the same flesh, blood and bone. You say you doubt me? I did that first. Nothing's harder than finding self-worth. When you feel like your heart, is just gonna burst, And that death would be better than life on this earth. Just take a moment, look to the sky. Look to the heavens above for some sign, But what you desires already inside, You just have to take it, this is your life! It's not easy, but uh, But that's why it's gonna feel so damn good. So at the end of the day. Keep one thing in mind  Life's not about what you've got in your bank It's about all the times and memories you make, With people who also feel hurt and feel pain. Don't ever forget that we all bleed the same. The world can be cruel and the people can too, But some of those people are honest and true, And if you think that the world is so bad, Maybe it's time to try being glad. Lifes what you make it, whatever you want, Don't focus so much on the things that you've got. Look at the horizon, then look beyond. Today I'm right here, but tomorrow I'm gone. I wish I could take all your pain and confusion, I'd lift it right off of your shoulders, and use it, If I could use all these words just to prove it, I'm right behind you, and I ain't moving. (CHORUS) Each breath is a gift that's worth more than Gold Your life is your story that's yet to be told. Be who you are, be ruthless and bold You wouldn't know warm if you weren't ever cold.. You're stronger in heart than you'll ever know. Lift up your glass, let's make a toast. To the ones who took life and made it their own, The people who fought and who and made themselves known. (CHORUS) To you, my friend, whoever, wherever you are. I know that this life, seems like it hasn't been easy so far. And tomorrow, we'll do this all again. And I promise, I'll be right behind you, Right up till the end."

You out there stressing I'm up in here coolin', We all know you're fake who you think you foolin'? Round-a-bout but I'm still turning, All I spit are spoken word sermons.

I ain't rich, and I'm unknown But stop talking about money, I don't like your tone. Look me in the eyes when you talking to me, Because you pay me respect, I don't want your money. I'm so down that I don't know what's up. But I don't drink so it's an empty cup. I sold my soul for a couple bucks, But I stole it back from the devil's clutch.

Hey! I see the penitentiary, one day And running from the police, that's right Mama catch me, put a whooping to my backside And even as a crack fiend, mama You always was a black queen, mama I finally understand For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it There's no way I can pay you back But the plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated Lady Don't ya know we love ya? Sweet lady Dear mama Place no one above ya, sweet lady You are appreciated Don't ya know we love ya? Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along I was looking for a father he was gone I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs They showed a young brother love I moved out and started really hanging I needed money of my own so I started slanging I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks It feels good putting money in your mailbox I love paying rent when the rent's due I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you 'Cause when I was low you was there for me And never left me alone because you cared for me And I could see you coming home after work late You're in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate Ya just working with the scraps you was given And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving But now the road got rough, you're alone You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own And there's no way I can pay you back But my plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated Lady Don't ya know we love ya? Sweet lady And dear mama Place no one above ya, sweet lady You are appreciated Don't ya know we love ya? Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama And when it seems that I'm hopeless You say the words that can get me back in focus When I was sick as a little kid To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act crazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret, always stayed real And I appreciate, how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day Everything will be alright if ya hold on It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on And there's no way I can pay you back But my plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated Lady Don't ya know we love ya?

13311,declaration-of-self,2016,foxal,Hip-Hop,"Woke up this morning, and opened my eyes, Sat up in bed and to my surprise, The world around me, it hasn't changed, Life's still hard, and people still fake, I sit here and ponder every mistake, And wonder why life still ain't going the way that I want. We all wish we could just turn things around sometimes but then we're reminded this life that we now live is full of surprises and words that are ad lib because you can't plan for a life this misguided and when who I am was never decided. So I hide it, I'm just too scared to ignite it, the fire inside, I'm frightened to find the pain of which I was once reminded. And I'm scared of silence. Cause when words leave off my brain turns on and my perspective widens. There's some things I don't want to find, like when I see all of my flaws and scream into the sky like ""Why God, Why?!"" Why don't I feel anymore, but at the same time I feel a hurt so deep that it cuts to my core? Why does my heart ache and my soul hurts even more? Why do I feel like no one cares and my friends walked out the door? I know, that I'm not alone, but I feel so isolated. If you care for me then why does every conversation feel so jaded? When I write these words I feel like the pen can barely take it. This music ain't for you, I write for me so that I can make it. If I'm colorblind then my own worth is violent shades of red. There's nothing more frightening than the thoughts inside my head, And if my own greatest sacrifice is living till I'm dead. But a thought within me tells me to fight the pain instead. This ain't the end, no, this is the beginning, I'm tired of being beaten down, so It's time that I start winning. I don't know if this is God, or a power deep within me, But all the sudden the dark inside, I feel it lifting. For the first time in my life, I can the world so clearly. All the pain that I feel inside, it send me reeling. But if I never got hurt then I wouldn't know healing And as the darkness fades away, I feel the light revere me... This is life! This is battle! The wounds and scars don't matter. I wasn't made for this, my bones feel like they'll shatter. If I take one more hit, I'm afraid I might go down. But at the same time I know, That I'll get up off the ground, And fight a battle that I can't win But it's all about the journey. Because we all love to win, but losing, is learning. Today I fight for freedom, Tomorrow for my kingdom. You and I, I got your back, Together we can beat em! I'm broken and I'm bruised, I'm hurt and I'm confused, I don't even understand myself but what do I got to lose? This is my calling, yeah, This is my creed! This is the time when I decide who I want me to be! See you judge me, but you haven't taken a step in my shoes. What will you do when it comes time to choose, To Fit in, or be you? See I've always chose the latter, And if you listen you can hear my voice through all the useless chatter. Screaming ""Why God, Why?"" But I know the answers inside, This is my life, my fight, I'll fight till I die! Today I'm lost, but tomorrow I'll find it. The strength that I need to get up and fight it!

Pinch my hand and breathe Feel like I'm getting lynched by my girl's family I gotta dream and it might seem thin But I couldn't breathe without it, it's my Siamese twin I sleep no more, dream with eyes open No more pills and no more potion No more being woken up By the explosion when the commotion errupts I sleep no more, dream with eyes open No more pills and no more potion No more being woken up By the man dumping his shit, unloading his truck I sleep no more Absence of occupation isn't rest [?] a mind vacant is another mind of distress [?] no rest for the wicked, yeah we could just kick it Or we could fucken stick it to the man Is this life, I'm watching bum's rifle threw rubbish Malnourished, another vicious growl from their stomachs How rubbish, another vicious row with the government Rummage through our cans and the council ain't loving it Nothing under this sun done change Monday to Sunday, life's mundane In one day Mundine took down Green In one day a stingray took our Steve Proven even our hero's are human Proven some come dumber than Sam Newman Ya loose, ya win, loose again Is this life the booze or hallucinogen So I move with the wind like willow But sin like bellow, my head hits the pillow And I'm gone, out for the count like Drak Bounce and I'm out like that, do ya feel me Yeah is this a dream Jump from a bridge, will I hit the street or wake up It just seems That I'm wasting my time praying for something greater Yeah is this a dream Will I be the man that I wanted to be as a kid It's not how it seems Don't wanna be remembered as another man that lived I sleep no more, dream with eyes open No more pills and no more potion No more being woken up By the explosion when the commotion errupts I sleep no more, dream with eyes open No more pills and no more potion No more being woken up By the man dumping his shit, unloading his truck I sleep no more Rest is excellent but bordom is his brother Death his cousin, age is his mother Cover your eyes, go to sleep sweet heart But when you wake you might find the grim reaper Standing at the end of your bed demanding to be fed Your soul sucked from that hole in ya head Not even Ned Kelly's armour could save ya The arm of the saviour lay ya to rest, so save ya breath To say your prayers even Satan says Realities a very sad state of affairs So beware of the screaming hyenas And only sleep seperates the dreams from the dreamers I sleep no more, dream with eyes open No more pills and no more potion No more being woken up By the explosion when the commotion errupts I sleep no more, dream with eyes open No more pills and no more potion No more being woken up By the man dumping his shit, unloading his truck I sleep no more ""In the evening when I wake up"" I dream with eyes, I dream with eyes open I sleep no more ""In the evening when I wake up"" I dream with eyes, I dream with eyes open ""In the evening when I wake up And my golden rainbow dawns In the proceeding moments just revolve, I lose myself"""
