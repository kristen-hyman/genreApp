Kiss her, kiss her I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late Write me off, give up on me Cause darling what did you expect I'm just off a lost cause A long shot, don't even take this bet You can make all the moves, you can aim all the spotlights Get all the sighs and the moans just right I'm just always on You said you'd keep me honest (you're always on) But I won't call you on it"

When I'm sick of this life I see It has to be my family who lift me off the floor Make sense of all the madness in a world full of money Full of tears, full of war I was a plowman and worked from the earth up Save your wine for the entrepreneurs Well all along the watchtower Princes kept the view While all the women came and went Barefoot servants, too Outside in the cold distance A wildcat did growl (like a failed man I worked from the earth up) Two riders were approaching And the wind begins to howl ('cause your world is the same as mine) Pour more blood in your cup Take a sip full of sin and let your taste buds savoir the buzz The flavor of an ill-mannered nature That lingers on as animals in all of us Trying to fight for the right to live a life But some will never win though that's why they live a lie I don't think I'll ever win all of this is anything When I die I hope a brother's at my side There's no trap door, or get out clause The world can be your oyster or a set of jail doors You've seen mine, I think it's time I see yours I bet you that we've been scarred by the same swords So we are not so unalike Apart from the fact I live my life in the light and now I'm trapped in it The way I feel within a few years time I might have a couple kids and just forget I ever wrote lyrics Well all along the watchtower Princes kept the view While all the women came and went Barefoot servants, too yeah Outside in the cold distance A wildcat did growl Two riders were approaching And the wind begins to howl Take away the treasure of a man Convinced that he holds heaven in his hands Even though I ain't religious I'm a little superstitious Maybe there is a promised land But will I make it or not is a different matter I've been a joker, I've been a thief, I've been a rapper I've been the only enemy that I can never beat Give me a piece of mind upon a platinum platter Well all along the watchtower Princes kept the view oh oh oh While all the women came and went Barefoot servants, too yeah Outside in the cold distance A wildcat did growl Two riders were approaching And the wind begins to howl"

Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth, None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."" ""No reason to get excited,"" the thief, he kindly spoke, ""There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke. But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate, So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."" All along the watchtower, princes kept the view While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too. Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl, Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl."
